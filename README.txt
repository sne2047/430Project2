This is my project 2 for IGME 430.
Use this document to keep track of plans, bugs i have to deal with but are tabling for now, etc

To-Dos:
Feedback that changing password did work
better css design
    -Forms still need work mostly.

Stretchier Goals:
ability to look at a user's dragons without avtually being logged in as them
    -a page for each user, perhaps /username shows their public page?
Make error messages less domo-like, appear in center rather than sliding in from edge
Some visual indication of having premium or not

Done:
Dragon art exists
Premium lock is in there and working
Nice background img
Change password WORKS
Account controller and models
Account is in index.js
Most of app.js, minus the redis
Added a favicon
Added login logo
middleware set up
router got account stuff in there
handlebars exists
Error messages working

Final notes:
Definetly more polish can be done, more can be added, but considering time restrictions and other finals?
It's submittable as-is. And I need to work on things for other classes, unfortunately.
