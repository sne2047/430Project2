This is my project 2 for IGME 430.
Use this document to keep track of plans, bugs i have to deal with but are tabling for now, etc

Current task: Get the basics of creating an account and logging into one copied from previous
First step of that is getting the controllers and models for accounts set up.
And also App.js needs to be done
Then some basic middleware and account stuff
and then some of the html pages for these basics

note- instead of /maker, send people to /dragons, the page that will show the user their created dragons
